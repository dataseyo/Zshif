## Research
I'm interested primarily in philosophy of physics, philosophy of science more generally, climate science, and social epistemology. My research currently involves:
- extending effective realism into the domain of QFT in curved spacetime. 
- carefully examining what philosophical work fields like numerical relativity can be made to do. They've traditionally been neglected as "tools that facilitate computation," but I think that Mark Wilson and others have made a good case for taking physics avoidance (and what facilitates it) seriously when interpreting, representating, and just thinking about theories. After all, such fields heavily contribute to the content of our theories: the field equations, when unsolved, aren't very useful.
- formulating a realism that both makes salient and takes advantage of the unique epistemic position we're in with respect to some contemporary theories; also, cashing out what this even looks like. 

In  the future, I hope to work on:

- making the notion of *robustness* more rigorous across the physical sciences, especially in QFT and stochastic/ensemble climate models. Building an analogy between robust entities/processes in biology and those in physics also appears potentially fruitful.
- making sense of what *an ontology indexed to scales* (or, per Ladyman, a *scale-relative ontology*) is supposed to mean, if there is sense to be made of it. 
- studying the behavior of laypeople and experts in discourse about some technical domain like climate science. 
- teasing out the physical significance of the large D limit of general relativity.

## What else?

I speak Korean and Japanese conversationally and somewhat professionally (though my proficiency in Japanese has been fading recently). I develop mostly in python and rarely in R. Besides standard numerical computing, I'm proficient in the various gravitational wave modules in python and in other popular physics modules. I've also worked with swarms, specifically in simulating their dynamics and processing related data.
