## Research
I'm interested primarily in philosophy of physics, philosophy of science more generally, climate science, and social epistemology. My research currently involves:
- extending Porter Williams' project of effective realism into the domain of QFT in curved spacetime. 
- carefully examining what philosophical work fields like numerical relativity can be made to do. They've traditionally been neglected as "tools that facilitate computation," but I think that Mark Wilson and others have made a good case for taking physics avoidance (and what facilitates it) seriously when interpreting, representating, and just thinking about theories.
- formulating a realism that both makes salient and takes advantage of the unique epistemic position we're in with respect to some contemporary theories; also, cashing out what exactly it means and looks like to be in a better epistemic position wrt. one theory than another.

## What else?

I speak Korean and Japanese conversationally and somewhat professionally (though my proficiency in Japanese has been fading recently). I develop mostly in python and rarely in R. Besides standard numerical computing, I'm proficient in the various gravitational wave modules in python and in other popular physics modules. I've also worked with swarms, specifically in simulating their dynamics and processing related data.
