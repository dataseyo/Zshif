## Research
My research is focused at the interface of physics and philosophy, but I also care deeply about the foundations of climate science and environmental ethics, social epistemology, and broader issues in the philosophy of science. Iâ€™m currently writing on: 

- how to extend the renormalization group from high energy physics and condensed matter physics into other fields. [Sethna](http://sethna.lassp.cornell.edu/research/why_is_science_possible) and [Bialek](http://www.princeton.edu/~wbialek/wbialek.html) have already done great work on this. 
- the epistemic and ontic implications of scale separation, decoupling, and effective field theories. We now have some tools that act to shield our theories from the unknown, and we've gotten very good at constraining the domains of our physical theories such that the threat from future theory change is minimized. It is therefore interesting to ask whether we're in a better epistemic position with respect to nature than past scientists, like Newton, who took their theories to apply universally. Similarly, many physicists (see Duncan's QFT text p.570, or Zeidler's QFT text p.192) have taken the separation of scales to be a kind of necessary precondition for science. It's what makes science possible, they say. Yet we know that sometimes scales fail to decouple; effective field theory methods fail. What does this mean for physics and metaphysics? 
- carefully examining what philosophical work fields like numerical relativity can be made to do. They've traditionally been neglected as "tools that facilitate computation," but I think that Mark Wilson and others have made a good case for taking physics avoidance (and what facilitates it) seriously when interpreting, representating, and just thinking about theories. After all, such fields heavily contribute to the content of our theories: the field equations, when unsolved, aren't very useful. I'd also like to know whether or not the "computational context" of a theory, for lack of a better phrase, bears on how we conceptualize and interpret it. By "computational context" I mean something like "what it requires to make a theory work, to formulate and solve its core equations, to model the world with it, to specify its target systems, etc." 

In  the future, I hope to work on:

- making the notion of *robustness* more rigorous across the physical sciences, especially in QFT and stochastic/ensemble climate models. Building an analogy between robust entities/processes in biology and those in physics also appears potentially fruitful.
- studying the relation between dualities (e.g., AdS/CFT) and the renormalization group (or other frameworks that QFT has borrowed from condensed matter physics). This would likely involve some talk of dualities in the context of the recent theoretical equivalence literature in philosophy. 
- making sense of what *an ontology indexed to scales* (or, per Ladyman, a *scale-relative ontology*) is supposed to mean, if there is sense to be made of it. 
- teasing out the physical significance of the large D limit of general relativity. 

## Projects

**Numerical Relativity:** a few students and professors from the philosophy, computer science, engineering, and physics departments working on software for extracting information about the source (mostly black holes) of chirps. We're also interested in expanding the libraries used for dealing with numerical relativistic simulations and matching methods. 

**EUGENE:** [Dynamical Kinds](https://github.com/jantzen/eugene)


## What else?

I speak Korean and Japanese conversationally and somewhat professionally (though my proficiency in Japanese has been fading recently). I develop mostly in python and rarely in R. Besides standard numerical computing, I'm proficient in the various gravitational wave modules and in other popular physics modules. I've also worked with swarms, specifically in simulating their dynamics and processing related data.
