Suppose that someone accuses you of being illogical, alleging that you should—as they do—use reason to come to your senses. You should invoke facts. You should stop being emotional and instead appeal to logic. What do they mean by logic? Are they accusing you of having constructed deductively invalid arguments? Does one of your inferences have an improper structure? Whatever they mean, logic and reason have some special sort of force. It's supposed to bad to be illogical, to be unresponsive to reason. I hope to show what this special force is and where it comes from. More importantly, I'll consider your accuser's attempted theft of this special force. Your accuser belongs to an increasingly popular group that I will call Logic Fetishists. But first, what even is logic?

## A Very Brief Introduction to Logic

(skip this if you know elementary propositional logic)

Formal logic deals strictly with the form of arguments, with the relation between premises and conclusions. An argument is any set of premises with a conclusion. Consider the following arguments (*) and (^):

(*)
1. If my friend is in jail, then it will rain.
2. My friend is in jail.
3. Therefore, it will rain.


(^)
1. If your house is on fire, then you should probably leave.
2. Your house is on fire.
3. Therefore, you should probably leave. (^)

Logic is blind to what all of these sentences mean in natural language: it sees only structure. Thus these two arguments end up being logically equivalent under the following form: 

1. If P, then Q
2. P
3. Therefore, Q

The logician has in her toolkit various methods to determine whether an argument is valid, or whether it is impossible for all the premises to be true and the conclusion false. In a valid argument, the conclusion is entailed by the premises. That is, if we assume that the premises are true, then the conclusion must follow. Both (*) and (^), as well as their more general P-and-Q form, are valid.
