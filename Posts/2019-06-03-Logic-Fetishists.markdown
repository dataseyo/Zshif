Suppose that someone accuses you of being illogical, alleging that you should—as they do—use reason to come to your senses. You should invoke facts. You should stop being emotional and instead appeal to logic. What do they mean by logic? Are they accusing you of having constructed deductively invalid arguments? Does one of your inferences have an improper structure? Whatever they mean, logic and reason have some special sort of force. It's supposed to bad to be illogical, to be unresponsive to reason. I hope to show what this special force is and where it comes from. More importantly, I'll consider your accuser's attempted theft of this special force. Your accuser belongs to an increasingly popular group that I will call Logic Fetishists. But first, what even is logic?

## A Very Brief Introduction to Logic

(skip this if you know elementary propositional logic)

Formal logic deals strictly with the form of arguments, with the relation between premises and conclusions. An argument is any set of premises with a conclusion. Consider the following arguments (*) and (^):

(*)
1. If my friend is in jail, then it will rain.
2. My friend is in jail.
3. Therefore, it will rain.


(^)
1. If your house is on fire, then you should probably leave.
2. Your house is on fire.
3. Therefore, you should probably leave. (^)

Logic is blind to what all of these sentences mean in natural language: it sees only structure. Thus these two arguments end up being logically equivalent under the following form: 

1. If P, then Q
2. P
3. Therefore, Q

The logician has in her toolkit various methods to determine whether an argument is valid, or whether it is impossible for all the premises to be true and the conclusion false. In a valid argument, the conclusion is entailed by the premises. That is, if we assume that the premises are true, then the conclusion must follow. Both (*) and (^), as well as their more general P-and-Q form, are valid. 

Formal logic isn't all there is. Some valid arguments are bad, and many invalid arguments are good. While valid, (*) is not a very good argument. While invalid, many scientific arguments are good. A popular example: 

1. The sun rose in the east yesterday.
2. The sun rose in the east the day before yesterday. 
3. The sun rose in the east the day before the day before yesterday.
4. The sun rose...
5. We have no good reason to expect that the sun will fail to rise tomorrow. 
6. Therefore, the sun will rise in the east tomorrow. 

Arguments of this form—inductive arguments—are always invalid. Yet we often believe that they give us good reason to accept the conclusion. Even so, logic is supposed to have some special force. It's good to provide a valid argument if possible. It's no doubt bad to purport to give a valid argument, yet give an invalid one.  If you set up a valid argument, all you have to do is prove that the premises are true! Further, the beliefs we hold have logical consequences. If I hold that P_1, ..., P_n are true, it might follow as a logical consequence that Q. If this is the case, I can't possibly deny Q while holding the former beliefs (of course, we can only set up reasonable expectations for the logical consequences that people should be aware of). The special force of logic is hopefully starting to make its way to the surface. Logic makes requirements of us. For example, I am only licensed to certain inferences. The premises of (^) license that I take the conclusion to be true, but it does not allow me to take the negation of the conclusion to be true. 

What then of reason? What reason means is far less than transparent (and is the subject of much contention) than logic. The requirements that rationality imposes on us are similarly elusive. Let's suppose that reason means something like "the procedures we go through to determine what to believe." And let's also take for granted that requirements similar to the following do exist, for at least some must if the Logic Fetishist's theft of rationality is to have any force:

- You should not believe both P and not-P.
- You must A if you believe that you ought A.
- You can only believe P if P is epistemically accessible to you (e.g., you're in a position to know that P).

Assuming that rationality does impose these requirements on us, to fail to satisfy these requirements is to be irrational. So, both logic and reason rely on a very involved background literature in philosophy, and both make requirements of us.

## The Special Force

When arguing with someone, we usually hope to establish that some proposition P (or set of propositions) is true. If we're on our best behavior, we provide good reason to believe P. We construct arguments so as to convince our interlocutor that P holds. Logic and reason appear to provide *normative* constraints on this activity. A normative constraint just is one that we ought abide by. Some of those normative constraints are the requirements that rationality makes of us, and others are dictated by logic. The special force held by logic and reason—over and above the Logic Fetishist's nemesis, emotion—is supplied by the normative constraints. 

But these constraints are only present when the usage of "logic" and "reason" are the usages salient in philosophical contexts. If in some context we find that logic means "what sounds right to Zach," we'll feel no normative pressure to constrain our arguments such that they sound right to Zach. The Logic Fetishist has stolen "logic" and "reason" without taking with them the special force. When the Logic Fetishist tells us that our argument is illogical, they do not mean that the premises fail to entail the conclusion. In their accusations of irrationality you will find that no substantive work has been done to establish that we've run afoul of, for example, the requirement to believe P only if P is epistemically accessible to us. They are not interested in the philosophical discourse surrounding rationality and what it requires of us. This would be okay but for the theft. Others also use "logic" in ways that fail to correspond exactly to what we mean by "logic" in philosophy (e.g., "your logic isn't convincing"). Unless we're snobs, we don't make anything of it. For they haven't tried to cut off the special force from its source. 

In summary, logic and rationality impose normative constraints on the arguments we make and reasons we give in favor of believing some proposition. The legitimacy of the normative constraints is sourced in the rigorous background fields against which logic and rationality are defined.</span>
