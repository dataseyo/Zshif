Suppose that someone accuses you of being illogical, alleging that you should—as they do—use reason to come to your senses. You should invoke facts. You should stop being emotional and instead appeal to logic. What do they mean by logic? Are they accusing you of having constructed deductively invalid arguments? Does one of your inferences have an improper structure? Whatever they mean, logic and reason have some special sort of force. It's supposed to bad to be illogical, to be unresponsive to reason. I hope to show what this special force is and where it comes from. More importantly, I'll consider your accuser's attempted theft of this special force. Your accuser belongs to an increasingly popular group that I will call Logic Fetishists. But first, what even is logic?
